// Hey Luca, here is some feedback for your Project-1. Overall you did a great job!
// I'm adding some code review here.

// Click the start button to start the game


$("#start").click(function() {
	// Populate the game
	// nice job factoring out these functions!
	getRandomQuestion();
	populate();
	// This could also be factored out into a function (outside of start)
	// updateTimer could also be defined outside of the countdown function and
	// simply called from inside the countdown function.

	// Countdown timer set up and set it to start when the `Start` button is clicked.
	function countdown( elementName, minutes, seconds ) {
    var element, endTime, hours, mins, msLeft, time;

    function twoDigits( n )
    {
        return (n <= 9 ? "0" + n : n);
    }

    function updateTimer()
    {
        msLeft = endTime - (+new Date);
        if ( msLeft < 1000 ) {
            element.innerHTML = "Trivia Quiz Is Over!";
        } else {
            time = new Date( msLeft );
            hours = time.getUTCHours();
            mins = time.getUTCMinutes();
            element.innerHTML = (hours ? hours + ':' + twoDigits( mins ) : mins) +
                ':' + twoDigits( time.getUTCSeconds() );
            setTimeout( updateTimer, time.getUTCMilliseconds() + 500 );
        }
    }

    element = document.getElementById( elementName );
    endTime = (+new Date) + 1000 * (60*minutes + seconds) + 500;
    updateTimer();
}

	countdown("countdown", 1, 0);
});

$(document).ready(function() {
	$("button").effect();
});

// populate function
